            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now part of our daily lives, it is used at work, school, on the roads when people are travelling, and even at homes. I have already defined 
            what AI is according to my perspective in the weekly blog, I defined it as a smart computer system that is created by humans to function with the efficiency of a human intellect.
            The main terms that are more important in this definition are a computer system, created, efficiency, and human intellect; I am saying these are the most important terms to take into consideration
            when defining what AI is because they are building blocks of it. To elucidate further, we can consider AI as an digital artwork that humans create to express themselves in a way, they create a system
            they imagined to have all the capabilities of a human, even ones that they themselves cannot reach or do. For example, ChatGPT which is an AI system that was created by OpenAI as a real language clarifying tool 
            that enables the user to have human-like dialogues using a talkbot (Ortiz, 2023). The artists created this digital artwork to allow people to be able to ask any questions they have in mind and get the answers 
            they want to hear also to help them complete tasks that are hard for them, like completing essays for school work.

            When it comes to the intellectual sense of the AI, same as human beings having different intellectual abilities, AI is designed the same. The intelligence of the AI is measured by how it was created to functions,
            there are two classifications of AI, these are the weak AI and the strong AI. A weak AI is a type of AI that was designed to do limited actions that a human being can do like giving directions, or driving a car; this
            AI was designed to perform only one task distinctively which shows that it is created to have restrictions and is controlled when it comes to the level of human intelligence it should have. An example of this is one that
            almost all of us know which is a Google Search, we all know that when we want to search for something, we are likely to use Google which gives us all the information we want from differnet sources. The weak AI is the type of AI 
            that not exist yet, a system that can come up with solutions to problems that they have never faced before like when human overcome obstacles they face in life. This is the type of AI that does not need to be controlled and
            constrained when it comes to the things it can do (Schroer, 2023). One of the examples of AI that Hans Pruijt looks at is ELIZA which is an AI that was part of the debate on the social iteraction with computers created by Weizenbaum 
            as a natural language processing system (2006: 516-517), the AI is used to give humans answers to all their questions when they communicate with it, this is to make them hear the answers they want to hear through a computer while they interact with it. 
            I consider ELIZA as a weak AI because it has limitaatios and constraints when it comes to what the response must be to the user, it takes the input from the user and is controlled as to what response it must say back to the user as the output (Pruijt, 2006: 518).
