          <h2 className='sub'>Graphics</h2>
          <p>
            I used images from <a className="u-url" href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a> as the background images on the cards in the homepage when the user scrolls down, then
            I used a video from <a className="u-url" href="https://za.pinterest.com/pin/1022317184140601879/">pinterest.com</a> as the background in the homepage because I want to give it the feel of future technology. I want
            the user to feel like they are about to experience the future of internet art while they are in the homepage. I didn't use images as backgrounds for the other pages because 
            I think they were going to make the layout look busy and do not want that to confuse the user an dmake it hard for them to read the content on the pages. The other graphics 
            I included are the wireframes I drew to illustrate the ideas of how I wanted the layout of my pages to be.
          </p>

          <h3 className='sub'>Font</h3>
          <p>
            I used Times New Roman from the font-family for the text in all the pages, because a lot of people are familiar with it since it is an old font,
            and it is used in many texts such as word documents, also because it is neat and easy to read as well as understand, and it has an economy of space for the reader to engage with a coherent text and be attracted to it at first glance. I used different
            font-sizes to best suit the layout, depending on how long the information is and to show which text is the heading or the subtitle, then I used different font-weights to specify which texts hold more important information to consider or pay attention to while reading.
            Most importantly I used this font family so that the web pages would have space, legibility, and order so that the reader neither gets confused on where to start reading nor finds it hard to digest the information.
          </p>

          <h4 className='sub'>Layout</h4>
          <p>
            My aim for this website was to ensure there's a smooth flow of the content on each page, from the homepage to the last one; there is readability, coherence, and order in the dev blogs; I narrowed the paragraphs so that the user does not have to 
            look across the entire width of the screen as a typewriter. I was working towards readability, coherence, and order, and I feel like I accomplished this with the graphics, font, and colour palette I used to design the website. To avoid making 
            the user go back and forth reading the content on the theory and design sections, I decided to integrate the contents that are supposed to be in each section, by integrating I mean I put all the information that has to be in the theory section in 
            one page and did the same for the design section as well. I did this layout also because I want the website to be simple and easier to navigate. Using the differnet background colours helped with the information easier to read and draw the readers eyes. 
            For the internet art page the user can read more about the design ideas on the rationale and preparatory work for it content in the dev blogs page.
          </p>

          <h5 className='sub'>Colour</h5>
          <p>
            I wanted to keep the aesthetic appeal fresh with a modern feel and easy to look at, I used about seven colours because I wanted to be exploratory and see if the colours will be complementary. I used a colour-blind-friendly palette which includes black, 
            white/cream-white, light-pink, light blue/aqua, grey,light orange and light red. I used these colours because I wanted the website to look youthful and I feel like the colours worked well together to emphasize that. For all the paragraph texts on the pages
            I used black to signify the power that the information holds and its elegance, also to avoid the text blending into the background colours. 
            I used white for some texts because it signifies simplicity and clarity like the links in the navigation bar. Grey, light pink, light red, light orange, and light blue were
            used as the background colours in the theory and design section pages to show the balance between the information in the pages and to show that each block has a different content on the page. I used these colours as background colours because I wanted to give the website some 
            youthfulness and bring a smooth flow of information, and I want the website to stay neutral between formality and informality, so a little pop of colour does the trick. I used aqua/light blue to make the links on all pages stand out especially on the footer, and show some stability and balance in the text;
            the dominating colour on this wesite is blue, this is so because I want it to look like it is showing the universe of the internet making everything around the world connect.
            All these colours were complementary, and I feel like so far, they work well together to achieve the youth idea of the website and its informality side.

          </figure>
          <p>
            I chose this layout because it allows users to have options to navigate to other pages effortlessly by including links and clickable cards. The interface will include images to make it attractive and compliment the kind of information that is conveyed in each section on the cards, and a video 
            as the background for the aesthetic appeal and attraction. The layout has negative space to show that the content is display to be readable, spacious, and legible.

          <p>
            I chose this layout because I was avoiding to make the user keep going back and forth form page to page to read the content that is in the design section, so I decided to place all the contents in one page and separate them using different background colours. I want to make a scroller for the display
            of the wireframes so I'm loking forward to designing that for the final website.

          <p>
            I chose this layout because I want the information that is supposed to be in the theory section to be in one place, so the user does not have to navigate from page to page to read the content.
            Same as the design section page, the content in this page will be separated using different background colours. I us the different bright colours because I want to catch the user's eye to want to read more.

          <p>
            I chose this layout because it will show all the things that I want the internet art to have which are images, texts, and icons. It is simple, legible, spacious, clear, as well as easy to navigate.

        <div className= 'UX'>
          <h1 className='subtitle1'> Rationale, UI & UX</h1>
          <p>
            The first thing I did before designing this websiteto show my intial ideas was to draw the wireframes, they helped me get ideas on how I could design the layouts of the pages.
            Then I downloaded and uploaded the videos as well as the images I was going to use for the design of the website in the right folders. I watched tutorial videos on YouTube to help me with the 
            process of the design because I needed help to clarify a few things with my coding, one of the videos I watched is by <a href="https://youtu.be/I2UBjN5ER4s" className="u-url">Brain Design</a>.
            I designed the website such that when the user wants to move from one page to another they can do that wtout any hesitations, I made all the links to other pages available and accessible to the user in all the pages.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the interface elements, in terms of the navigational components I used slider cards on the homepage, pagination for every page, icons to signify what the specific text is 
            based on. Tags showing what a certain image is signifying, hyperlinks to show the links like in the navigation bar. For input controls I used buttons for the scroller and the send button in the footer when the user is done writing 
            their email address if interested, I used toggles to make the navigation easy for the user to move between
            the pages. The information components then include the use of icons, and a dialogue box for the user to read additional information.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first thing I want the user to see when they first browse through the homepage is the nice vidoe I put as the background, then the navgational bar which will take them to other pages. as they navgate down the page 
            they will see the design and the theory sections which will take them to the other pages that hold the content. The web design page will show the viewer all the content about the wireframes andeven show illustrations, the styleguide, rationale, UI and Ux all in one page.
            The theory section will show the dev blog, essay, all preparatory work and rationale for the artwork, and the independent research and reflection all in one page. The different contents will be diplayed and differentiated using different
            backgrund colours to make each on stand out.
          </p>

          <p>
            My main goal for the design of this website was to design a website that is going to be interacted with by the general audience, I want it for feel like the user is learning and interacting
            with the digital space, were everything is designed through algorithmic tools. The UX is meant to make the user feel involved in the growth of the new technological innovations,
            and see how these transformations are changing the world as they read through the content in the theory section page.
            For both the UI and UX, I wanted the user to have fun navigating the website, feel keen to know what information other web pages hold, explore the internet art, and express their emotions by giving feedback. 
            I will briefly explain my design choices focusing on four aspects of the visual representation: typography, colour, graphics, and layout.
          </p>

          <p>
            •	<span>Typography</span>: I used Times New Roman for the font because it is legible, readable, and spacious, it gives the reader a coherent text to engage with. Most people are familiar with it because it is an old font, it is neat and easy to understand. 
            I used different font sizes and font weights to complement the layout on each page and to differentiate between texts like showing which one is the heading to draw the user's attention, so that they do not become confused about where to start reading and what the content is about 
            since headings can give the reader an insight on what they are going to read about. I also used different font weights to specify which text holds important information and has a brief content following it.
          </p>

          <p>
            •	<span>Colour</span>: I wanted to keep the aesthetic appeal fresh with a modern feel and easy to look at, I used about seven colours because I wanted to be exploratory and see if the colours will be complementary. I used a colour-blind-friendly palette which includes black, 
            white/cream-white, light-pink, light blue/aqua, grey,light orange and light red. I used these colours because I wanted the website to look youthful and I feel like the colours worked well together to emphasize that. For all the paragraph texts on the pages
            I used black to signify the power that the information holds and its elegance, also to avoid the text blending into the background colours. 
            I used white for some texts because it signifies simplicity and clarity like the links in the navigation bar. Grey, light pink, light red, light orange, and light blue were
            used as the background colours in the theory and design section pages to show the balance between the information in the pages and to show that each block has a different content on the page. I used these colours as background colours because I wanted to give the website some 
            youthfulness and bring a smooth flow of information, and I want the website to stay neutral between formality and informality, so a little pop of colour does the trick. I used aqua/light blue to make the links on all pages stand out especially on the footer, and show some stability and balance in the text;
            the dominating colour on this wesite is blue, this is so because I want it to look like it is showing the universe of the internet making everything around the world connect.
            All these colours were complementary, and I feel like so far, they work well together to achieve the youth idea of the website and its informality side.
          </p>

          <p>
            •	<span>Graphics</span>: I did not use images as backgrounds this time around because I felt like they were going to make the layout look too busy and they might blend in with the text. I used an internet globe video from Pinterest for the background of the home page to make it stand out and be eye-catchy. I then used images from unsplash.com for
            the cards in the homepage to show what each cards' content is, I chose to use these images for aesthetic appeal and attraction. I resized and compressed the images so that they do not take too much space, and don't 
            take time to load when the website starts. I used simple images as possible, to bring the peaceful and calming aesthetic when the user navigates through the pages, then I included graphics that I designed myself like 
            on the wireframes content.
          </p>

          <p>
            •	<span>Layout</span>: I was working towards readability, coherence, and order, and I feel like I accomplished this with the graphics, font, and colour palette I used to design the website. To avoid making the user go back and forth reading the content on the theory and design sections, I decided
            to integrate the contents that are supposed to be in each section, by integrating I mean I put all the information that has to be in the theory section in one page and did the same for the design section as well. I did this layout also because I want the website to be simple and easier to navigate.
            Using the differnet background colours helped with the information easier to read and draw the readers eyes. For the internet art page the user can read more about the design ideas on the rationale and preparatory work for it content in the dev blogs page.
          </p>

          <p>
            My UI and UX thus far I believe are well done, and I am working to implement them more and bring better changes to the design using the feedback I am yet to receive. The user interface of the website should have an intellectual, spiritual, and emotional connection with the user; 
            the functionality and usability of the website must be investigated more through prototypes and wireframes to end up with a design with good UI and UX.
