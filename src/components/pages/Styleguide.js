          <h2 className='sub'>Graphics</h2>
          <p>
            I used images from <a className="u-url" href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a> as the background images on the cards in the homepage when the user scrolls down, then
            I used a video from <a className="u-url" href="https://za.pinterest.com/pin/1022317184140601879/">pinterest.com</a> as the background in the homepage because I want to give it the feel of future technology. I want
            the user to feel like they are about to experience the future of internet art while they are in the homepage. I didn't use images as backgrounds for the other pages because 
            I think they were going to make the layout look busy and do not want that to confuse the user an dmake it hard for them to read the content on the pages. The other graphics 
            I included are the wireframes I drew to illustrate the ideas of how I wanted the layout of my pages to be.

          <h3 className='sub'>Font</h3>
          <p>
            I used Times New Roman from the font-family for the text in all the pages, because a lot of people are familiar with it since it is an old font,
            and it is used in many texts such as word documents, also because it is neat and easy to read as well as understand, and it has an economy of space for the reader to engage with a coherent text and be attracted to it at first glance. I used different
            font-sizes to best suit the layout, depending on how long the information is and to show which text is the heading or the subtitle, then I used different font-weights to specify which texts hold more important information to consider or pay attention to while reading.
            Most importantly I used this font family so that the web pages would have space, legibility, and order so that the reader neither gets confused on where to start reading nor finds it hard to digest the information.

          <h4 className='sub'>Layout</h4>
          <p>
            My aim for this website was to ensure there's a smooth flow of the content on each page, from the homepage to the last one; there is readability, coherence, and order in the dev blogs; I narrowed the paragraphs so that the user does not have to 
            look across the entire width of the screen as a typewriter. I was working towards readability, coherence, and order, and I feel like I accomplished this with the graphics, font, and colour palette I used to design the website. To avoid making 
            the user go back and forth reading the content on the theory and design sections, I decided to integrate the contents that are supposed to be in each section, by integrating I mean I put all the information that has to be in the theory section in 
            one page and did the same for the design section as well. I did this layout also because I want the website to be simple and easier to navigate. Using the differnet background colours helped with the information easier to read and draw the readers eyes. 
            For the internet art page the user can read more about the design ideas on the rationale and preparatory work for it content in the dev blogs page.

          <h5 className='sub'>Colour</h5>
          <p>
            I wanted to keep the aesthetic appeal fresh with a modern feel and easy to look at, I used about seven colours because I wanted to be exploratory and see if the colours will be complementary. I used a colour-blind-friendly palette which includes black, 
            white/cream-white, light-pink, light blue/aqua, grey,light orange and light red. I used these colours because I wanted the website to look youthful and I feel like the colours worked well together to emphasize that. For all the paragraph texts on the pages
            I used black to signify the power that the information holds and its elegance, also to avoid the text blending into the background colours. 
            I used white for some texts because it signifies simplicity and clarity like the links in the navigation bar. Grey, light pink, light red, light orange, and light blue were
            used as the background colours in the theory and design section pages to show the balance between the information in the pages and to show that each block has a different content on the page. I used these colours as background colours because I wanted to give the website some 
            youthfulness and bring a smooth flow of information, and I want the website to stay neutral between formality and informality, so a little pop of colour does the trick. I used aqua/light blue to make the links on all pages stand out especially on the footer, and show some stability and balance in the text;
            the dominating colour on this wesite is blue, this is so because I want it to look like it is showing the universe of the internet making everything around the world connect.
            All these colours were complementary, and I feel like so far, they work well together to achieve the youth idea of the website and its informality side.

          <h6 className='sub'>BRIEFLY REVISED GUIDE:</h6>
          <p>
            The website still uses the same font, colours excluding light orange and light red, and graphics inluding more images both designed by me and the ones I downloaded. I changed the layout of the pages in the theory section and the design section because I did not want the ser to be overwhelmed with a lot of text 
            and background colours when I added more blogs. I made the layout of all the pages the same excluding the homepage of cause so that I can keep the consistency.
