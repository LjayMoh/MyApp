               <p>
                  In the past years the definition of art has been explored and artists as well as researchers have 
                  been trying to figure out what can be classified as art and what cannot. As I have mentioned in my 
                  other blogs that the definitions of art vary but they can all have a common perspective that almost everyone can agree on, 
                  and this is that art is a way of expressing oneself, artists design art to express their desires, experiences, and opinions. 
                  The growth and innovations of new technologies have separated art into different categories, for example, 
                  algorithmic art which is art created using computer programmes (Mazzone and Elgammal, 2019: 1), 
                  and traditional art which is art created using traditional tools like paintings. 
                  Computers generate art and they are doing a mind-blowing job, but the question is, can these computers 
                  be classified as artists? This is a tricky question, and it can have both yes/no answers, 
                  because human beings are the ones who create computers then they use these computers to create art. 
                  Technological innovations have made artists use algorithmic tools to create art and with these tools, they also created AI (Artificial Intelligence). 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In his essay, Can Computers Create Art? Aaron Hertzmann discusses if AI can produce art, I found this interesting because 
                  artificial intelligence is taking over, and it is the future (2018). Before we can conclude that AI can produce art and 
                  can be considered as the artist, we should bear in mind that computers were also created by people meaning 
                  “… there is always a human behind the artwork.” (Hertzmann, 2019:13). Artists keep on exploring and creating new 
                  products using programming which results in the creation of new digital artworks which enlighten people about the algorithms of the internet. 
                  Now, we are looking at what artificial intelligence is and how it influences art.  Schroer defines AI as 
                  “a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks 
                  that typically require human intelligence.” (2023). In simple words, AI is a smart computer system that is created by humans 
                  to function with the efficiency of a human intellect. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  AI is created to do all the things a human can do, and this can be scary because human beings will end up with nothing to do as the AI is taking over, 
                  from playing games to problem-solving (Schroer, 2023). Although these innovations are growing the world and improving creativity, 
                  people can end up losing their jobs and lose interest in finding ways to problem-solve since they won’t have to do the reasoning anymore, 
                  there will also be fewer social interactions between people as most of them will be interacting a lot with their computers. 
                  AI is used to create all the things that can be misbeliefs when it comes to the real world, the art that is created by the 
                  computer is not as natural as the art created by the human, this is because the human creates art to show other people how they 
                  feel about the  real world and how they see it, while computational art is art that is created using data that can be destroyed at any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to Mazzone and Elgammal, AI is more than just a tool used by artists to create art, it is like a “medium” (2019:8), 
                  which means that it has more than just tools for functioning and creating art, it has all the restrictions and many prospects that it 
                  obeys for it to create art. Computers cannot be considered as artists because they create art to complete the task that a human being gave to them, 
                  they create what they are instructed to do not what they feel like creating to express themselves. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The technology has innovated art to become more delightful and improve artists’ skills through using new tools to create art, 
                  they moved from traditional productions to mechanical productions. People around the world can even access the artworks from all 
                  parts of the world through the internet since the artworks are computer-generated. There are AIs which humans create and control them 
                  to learn how human thinking functions and know what is good and bad, then there are ones which do not have supervision meaning they are not 
                  controlled to see what good and bad is and how a human is supposed to think; these unsupervised AIs could end up being the future, 
                  whereby they can control themselves and do whatever they want. This scares me a lot because what if we are literally creating monsters?

              <h5 className='sub'>The future of Digital Arts in Africa</h5>
              <p>
                According to Lizelle Bisschoff, the new age of digital technology has made people from other continents to learn and have more information about
                Africa, this includes information shared on the internet about Africa's histories, cultures, and the people. It is now easier because of the digital technologies for 
                people from different continents to have more information about others (Bisschoff, 2017:261), which makes it easy for societies to connect. 
                Digital technology is playing a big role in letting artists in Africa explore art to their fullest potential, the new technological innovations have 
                unleashed the creativity in artists (Bisschoff, 2017:261). Artists now use technology to ensure that people can access and criticize their artworks through sharing them 
                on digital platforms, for example, sharing comic pages on Instagram.
              </p>
              <p>
                Africa is one of the continents that were able to connect and adapt to new technologies faster, the people did not need accessibility to computers for them to know about 
                the internet as they already have smartphones (Bisschoff, 2017:261). This means that it got simple for the people in Africa to share their informationso athe others can access it and learn more about the
                African stories, it made communication and sharing of information as well as art more easier and artists have been using the digital technologies to share their traditional artworks by making digital 
                copies of them and sharing them on the internet. Since a lot of the citizens in Africa have access and are using digital technologies this enables high possibilities of new technological 
                innovations in the continent. The most important part for digital arts to grow more in Africa is accessibility and the use of the technologies (Bisschoff, 2017: 262) that the citizens are able to adapt to and understand 
                especially the internet since it is the biggest platform the people can use to share and access information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Digital Arts in playing a huge role in changing the way we see art and how we can interpret as well as criticize it, it includes a wide range of artistic creations, like websites or animations. It has improved artistic works
                to make them more interactive and make the spectators feel like they are part of the artistic world. As Bisschoff states that "digital technologies have further broken down the boundaries between artist and audience, and often 
                promote a formof interactivity." (2017: 263); in other words digital art has opened a wide connection between the artist and the audience, for example, when an artist shares a digital artwork on social media everyone is allowed to share 
                their thoughts about the artwork and have a conversation with the artist via a comment section, like the content shared on YouTube where the artist can open the comment section to allow their work to be criticized by the spectators.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the information that is shared about Africa is through digital artworks like websites, games, animations, and comics; this is because many artists in Africa want to express their African traditions, cultures, and histories through 
                what they know will connect to the audience and be interactive as well as easy to understand. African artists' aim when designing these artworks is to make sure that they can all relate to African audiences and represent African heritage as is
                without faking the realities happening in Africa (Pijnaker and Spronk, 2017: 328). The information we read and acquire from the internet can always shape our societal norms, so the message that artists are trying to convey and share through digital artworks can
                also change how society wants to see the world; all these changes and different perspectives about the digital artworks as well as how they influence the people are the main intriuging part for artists to continue wanting to explore and produce artistic creations
                and keep innovating new technologies.

              <h3 className='sub'>Social Media being a platform to share works of Art.</h3>
              <p>
                Social networking plaforms have been a way to connect artists from different diversities and continents. A lot of them have been and still are using it as a platform to share their artworks and let people criticize them, this makes the audience participate in the design process
                and make the product user friendly as well as more engaging and interactive. Social media platforms like Instagram are now part of our daily lives where people can easily access other people's shared work and information about politics, health, geographical location, and many more.
                The application is used by a more than 1 billion people (Xaba et al. 2021: 85), which makes it a good platform for people to connect and share different contents. It is an open space for emerging artists to get connections and expose their capabilities and talents to the world for 
                others and companies to take them into consideration. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Instagram is one of the best social media I know that can spread information with a blink of an eye, its spreads information fast and people communicate to share what is going on in their lives. The more followers an artist can get or have, the more chances for them to succeed and be approached 
                by different companies to do project to them (Xaba et al. 2021: 85-86). Artists mus use every chance they get when they have access to the internet to unleash their creativity to the world, the digtal age has made it easy for everyone to be creative and share their artworks all over the world without them have to travel
                from one country to the next to spread their talent. It is the future of digital art and people are living to undertand the algorithms of this internet art for them to succeed as well. It is a good way for artists to make easy moeny as they can also sell their artworks online without anyone stopping them.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a digital artist as well I do believe that Instagram and other accessible social platforms are playing a big role in the era to help artist like me to improve their artworks and share them easily which strengthens connections and interactivity between the audience and the artist.
