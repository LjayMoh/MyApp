            <h2 className='sub'>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              We live in a time where everything is forever changing, and this change involves the growth of digital technology and 
              its impact on how information is accessed and shared. Our social interactions are influenced by the new innovations of technology, 
              and these interactions are somehow constructed by how we interact with the information we get and how this information shapes us. 
              Internet has been around for a long time, and it connects a lot of people from different spheres of life, including artists, 
              they have used the internet as a platform to share their artworks so people can engage, criticize, admire, and analyze them virtually. 
              It is now used to share information around the world so that everyone can access it. 
            </p>
            <p>
              David Carrier stated that, "the natural home of art criticism is now the internet, ..." (2020), 
              meaning the internet is a platform for everyone to display their work and let it be critiqued directly without them having to admire the artwork in person, 
              moving art to the internet helps us understand and learn how its algorithm functions. Artists have been using and experimenting with the internet’s algorithms 
              to see how they can produce art that can be accessed on the internet and for the internet, this art is what we call “Net/Web art”. 
              This essay will explain what net art is and give an analysis of a net art that addresses my area of interest and articulates my aesthetic, technical, and conceptual extent.
            </p>
              
            <h3 className='sub'>What is Net/Web art?</h3>
            <p>
              Net art is art that can only be found on the internet and is created on the internet, meaning without the internet’s existence it cannot exist. 
              This is art that existed many years back which shows the history of art on the internet designed by activists, for us to understand and make meaning of what art is, 
              we must understand where it comes from, in this case net art helps us with that. Majority of the net artworks are not seen as interesting and spectators do not see their aesthetic appeals,
              reason being that these artworks are now considered unpleasing due to the post-internet art. This is because there are innovations of new internet arts which are produced using new technologies 
              with better user interfaces and experiences. This means that art keeps on being influenced by the internet and the internet keeps on influencing the art, 
              what I mean by this is that art uses the algorithms of the internet to show the audience what it is all about and how it can be used for new experiments, on the other hand, 
              the internet displays art to share new information and make copies of original artworks by digitizing them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A copy of the original artwork will be what is displayed and what the audience will be criticizing, which makes me think of whether the copy of the artwork on the internet carries more value and 
              aesthetic appeal than the physical original artwork. The art moving from traditional art to digital art will have a better detail than it would in person as the algorithms of the internet can make it look better, 
              thereof the spectator will analyze the art on the internet differently than they would in person. We can refer to this transfer of art to the internet as migration, which is a strategy whereby artworks 
              are conveyed from old-fashioned technologies to modernized technologies. It is used to make the existence of artworks durable, to neither be dismantled nor forgotten due to resuming them constantly (Rubio & Wharton, 2020:239). 
              This migration causes continuous changing of the original work to reproduce the new one so that the original can be separated from the copy. It requires more work and experiments for artists to establish that the copy still 
              delivers the same meaning as the original even though the internal and external structures may be distinct. The internet is now a platform that enables artists to do migration of their artworks so that everyone can access them 
              and make them exist for a long time for generations to come until there are new innovations.

            <h4 className='sub'>The <em>/death/ null</em> by Ulf Schelth (2010)</h4>
            <p>
              The net art that interested me is /death/ null by Ulf Schleth which has been around for more than ten years, see figure 1 which shows the interface of the net art below. Schleth explains it as “a place to bury hatchet. Immortalise the ephemeral. 
              Make a meme memorial. Mark a mortal thought. An Obytuary.” (2010), to elucidate this in simple words, the net art is about taking other artworks and placing them in a safe digital space where they will not lose their existence 
              anytime soon and other user will be able to interact with them when they navigate to the graveyard page where they can access all files. 
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
              The art’s interface is simple and easy to navigate through as we can see by the image above which shows the page where all the art is transferred to when the user buries their files (the graveyard page), 
              the developer used a simple and colour-blind-friendly palette for the website, he used black as the dominant colour for the text to give us the content. The background is grey to show the importance of the text in each page, 
              then there are white text boxes to show the user where they have to interact with the website and fill in the necessary information. Black, white, and grey are the colours I like to use in all the websites I create same as this website, 
              they bring out the aesthetic appeal of a simple website, and make the layout of each page easy to interact with, the beauty of the art lies in the way a user can always go back to access all the files they buried for memories whereby some 
              can cause nostalgia. It does not matter what type of file the user wants to bury the graveyard accepts all formats of files, it allows the user to bury everything and anything they want, and they can access them anytime and make other people 
              access them as well since the files are not hidden. The layout of the website is nothing complicated it is legible, readable, as well as spacious, the content is easy to understand as the text is kept written in simple terms so that the user does not get confused (Schelth, 2010). 
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a heading in bold letters to show the user what the interface is about which is /death/ null; under the heading there are three navigation links which navigates the user to other pages on the website these are interface, graveyard, and about. 
              The body of the website in the interface page which plays as the home page in the website shows the subtitle written in bold, there is a form where the user can fill in their details to interact with the website, since the website is about burying or migrating 
              (which I briefly discussed above) files into a safe space there is a selection button where the user can select files from their systems which they wish to bury in the null. Then there is a form that allows the user to type in their email address if 
              they want to receive a link to the website or page that will show them their buried files; and lastly there is a button that enables the user to be able to bury their files once they are done with the selection of the file they want to bury. 
              The graveyard page shows the user all the different files that were buried from old files to recent ones, this includes almost all types of files like .pdfs, .jpgs, .html files, etc. I like how the developer made the files have different colour-palettes 
              with the name of the files and the date to show when it was buried, this also helps the user to be able to classify their files. The about page then explains what the website is all about and how it all started, this helps the user understand the design and ideas behind the net art.
            </p>
            <p>
              The net art made me think about a topic we discussed last year about digital fragility and the migration of digital files to increase their life span. Digital fragility simply explained is data shown through symbols that can be easily destroyed by mechanical innovations. 
              Data that is basically weak and stored in different file formats and is temporary (Rubio & Wharton, 2020: 216). Looking back at the net art we can see that the data is stored in an old-fashioned way which does not require much code, so the information stored can be 
              easily destroyed as it needs to be constantly updated and modernized. The files are transferred from one place to another, and it is this continuous transfer of these files that causes them to be destroyed where the user can get a notification saying “the file does not exist…” 
              when they try to access it after some time, by virtue of it constantly changing from ones and zeros to zeros and ones to suit the kind of software it is moved to (Schwarz et al. in Rubio & Wharton 2020: 218).
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, the net art uses internet as a medium to store information from ages back, this information is stored in different types of file formats for a great user experience, as the user can bury any type of file they want no matter how small or vague the information in the file is. 
              The <em>/death/ null</em> helps artists to be able to access work from other artists, it carries memories of different people from all over the world which brings out its aesthetic appeal. We cannot always depend on the neat art to keep memories though because the files are digital, 
              and they can easily be destroyed by new technological innovations which change the algorithms of the internet. The net art is still useful for enabling users to bury files they do not really want to delete, and still want to access in future, but nobody knows how long the files 
              will be of existence with all the changes and innovations that are happening with post-internet art. I wish to design a website like this, where the user will be able to bury files and interact with other people’s files to see memories they can relate to.
