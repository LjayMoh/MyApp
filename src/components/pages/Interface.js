          <p>
            The first thing I did before designing this website to show my intial ideas was to draw the wireframes, they helped me get ideas on how I could design the layouts of the pages.
            Then I downloaded and uploaded the videos as well as the images I was going to use for the design of the website in the right folders. I watched tutorial videos on YouTube to help me with the coding 
            process of the design because I needed help to clarify a few things with my coding, one of the videos I watched was by <a href="https://youtu.be/I2UBjN5ER4s" className="u-url">Brain Design</a>.
            I designed the website such that when the user wants to move from one page to another they can do that without any hesitations or confusion, I made all the links to other pages available and accessible to the user in all the pages.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the interface elements, in terms of the navigational components I used slider cards on the homepage, pagination for every page, icons to signify what the specific text is 
            based on. Tags showing what a certain image is signifying, hyperlinks to show the links like in the navigation bar. For input controls I used buttons for the scroller and the send button in the footer when the user is done writing 
            their email address if interested, I used toggles to make the navigation easy for the user to move between
            the pages. The information components then include the use of icons, and a dialogue box for the user to read additional information.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first thing I want the user to see when they first browse through the homepage is the attrating digital video I put as the background, then the navigational bar which will take them to other pages. As they navigate down the page 
            they will see the design and the theory sections which will take them to the other pages that hold the specified content. The web design page will show the viewer all the content about the wireframes and even show illustrations, the styleguide, rationale, UI and UX all in one page.
            The theory section will show the dev blogs, essay, all preparatory work and rationale for the artwork, and the independent research and reflection all in one page. The different contents will be diplayed and differentiated using different
            backgrund colours to make each one of them stand out.
          </p>

          <p>
            My main goal for the design of this website was to design a website that is going to be interacted with by the general audience, I want it for feel like the user is learning and interacting
            with the digital space, were everything is designed through algorithmic tools. The UX is meant to make the user feel involved in the growth of the new technological innovations,
            and see how these transformations are changing the world as they read through the content in the theory section page.
            For both the UI and UX, I wanted the user to have fun navigating the website, feel keen to know what information other web pages hold, explore the internet art, and express their emotions by giving feedback. 
            I will briefly explain my design choices focusing on four aspects of the visual representation: typography, colour, graphics, and layout.
          </p>

          <p>
            •	<span>Typography</span>: I used Times New Roman for the font because it is legible, readable, and spacious, it gives the reader a coherent text to engage with. Most people are familiar with it because it is an old font, it is neat and easy to understand. 
            I used different font sizes and font weights to complement the layout on each page and to differentiate between texts like showing which one is the heading to draw the user's attention, so that they do not become confused about where to start reading and what the content is about 
            since headings can give the reader an insight on what they are going to read about. I also used different font weights to specify which text holds important information and has a brief content following it.
          </p>

          <p>
            •	<span>Colour</span>: I wanted to keep the aesthetic appeal fresh with a modern feel and easy to look at, I used about seven colours because I wanted to be exploratory and see if the colours will be complementary. I used a colour-blind-friendly palette which includes black, 
            white/cream-white, light-pink, light blue/aqua, grey,light orange and light red. I used these colours because I wanted the website to look youthful and I feel like the colours worked well together to emphasize that. For all the paragraph texts on the pages
            I used black to signify the power that the information holds and its elegance, also to avoid the text blending into the background colours. 
            I used white for some texts because it signifies simplicity and clarity like the links in the navigation bar. Grey, light pink, light red, light orange, and light blue were
            used as the background colours in the theory and design section pages to show the balance between the information in the pages and to show that each block has a different content on the page. I used these colours as background colours because I wanted to give the website some 
            youthfulness and bring a smooth flow of information, and I want the website to stay neutral between formality and informality, so a little pop of colour does the trick. I used aqua/light blue to make the links on all pages stand out especially on the footer, and show some stability and balance in the text;
            the dominating colour on this wesite is blue, this is so because I want it to look like it is showing the universe of the internet making everything around the world connect.
            All these colours were complementary, and I feel like so far, they work well together to achieve the youth idea of the website and its informality side.
          </p>

          <p>
            •	<span>Graphics</span>: I did not use images as backgrounds this time around because I felt like they were going to make the layout look too busy and they might blend in with the text. I used an internet globe video from Pinterest for the background of the home page to make it stand out and be eye-catchy. I then used images from unsplash.com for
            the cards in the homepage to show what each cards' content is, I chose to use these images for aesthetic appeal and attraction. I resized and compressed the images so that they do not take too much space, and don't 
            take time to load when the website starts. I used simple images as possible, to bring the peaceful and calming aesthetic when the user navigates through the pages, then I included graphics that I designed myself like 
            on the wireframes content.
          </p>

          <p>
            •	<span>Layout</span>: I was working towards readability, coherence, and order, and I feel like I accomplished this with the graphics, font, and colour palette I used to design the website. To avoid making the user go back and forth reading the content on the theory and design sections, I decided
            to integrate the contents that are supposed to be in each section, by integrating I mean I put all the information that has to be in the theory section in one page and did the same for the design section as well. I did this layout also because I want the website to be simple and easier to navigate.
            Using the differnet background colours helped with the information easier to read and draw the readers eyes. For the internet art page the user can read more about the design ideas on the rationale and preparatory work for it content in the dev blogs page.
          </p>

          <p>
            My UI and UX thus far I believe are well done, and I am working to implement them more and bring better changes to the design using the feedback I am yet to receive. The user interface of the website should have an intellectual, spiritual, and emotional connection with the user; 
            the functionality and usability of the website must be investigated more through prototypes and wireframes to end up with a design with good UI and UX.
          </p>

          <h2 className='subtitle1'>IMPROVEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS:</h2>
          <p>
            The main area that I have to improve when it comes to the design of my websites is making sure that the user interfaces are easy to understand and navigate, I feel like the user experience is already looking good and the website is interactive. I just have to work hard with improving my coding skills to 
            develop the crazy ideas that I have in mind for my website. I honestly did not know where to start with the kind of design ideas that I had for my internet art, but I still found courage to do the best I could to create the internet art that I had in mind and make the whole website funtion as an art itself.
            To do this, I changed the layour of the pages in the website and added more pages to make the navigation easier and more exciting for the user, since in the previous website I did not add a lot of pages that seemed king of boring and overwhelming to the user as the content in the theory section was in one page;
            I changed how I wanted the user experience to be and I made it more open for the user to read content that they want to read by navigating to its page rather than getting all the different contents in one page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website does not fully function as an internet art but I believe it does give a feel of the kind of design I was going for for my internet art. I wanted to keep everything simple and easy to interact with so I developed a website that is full of digital art images to show the future of digital technologies in our lives
            and how people now use these technologies in their daily lives while stil learnig to adapt to the new innovations of technology that they have to live and literally survive with. For me to tackle the issues that I have with my coding skills I willing design more websites on my spare time so that I can improve my developer skills
            and think out of the box with my designs while keeping them simple.
