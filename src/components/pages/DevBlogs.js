            <h2 className='sub'>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              We live in a time where everything is forever changing, and this change involves the growth of digital technology and 
              its impact on how information is accessed and shared. Our social interactions are influenced by the new innovations of technology, 
              and these interactions are somehow constructed by how we interact with the information we get and how this information shapes us. 
              Internet has been around for a long time, and it connects a lot of people from different spheres of life, including artists, 
              they have used the internet as a platform to share their artworks so people can engage, criticize, admire, and analyze them virtually. 
              It is now used to share information around the world so that everyone can access it. 
            </p>
            <p>
              David Carrier stated that, "the natural home of art criticism is now the internet, ..." (2020), 
              meaning the internet is a platform for everyone to display their work and let it be critiqued directly without them having to admire the artwork in person, 
              moving art to the internet helps us understand and learn how its algorithm functions. Artists have been using and experimenting with the internet’s algorithms 
              to see how they can produce art that can be accessed on the internet and for the internet, this art is what we call “Net/Web art”. 
              This essay will explain what net art is and give an analysis of a net art that addresses my area of interest and articulates my aesthetic, technical, and conceptual extent.
            </p>
              
            <h3 className='sub'>What is Net/Web art?</h3>
            <p>
              Net art is art that can only be found on the internet and is created on the internet, meaning without the internet’s existence it cannot exist. 
              This is art that existed many years back which shows the history of art on the internet designed by activists, for us to understand and make meaning of what art is, 
              we must understand where it comes from, in this case net art helps us with that. Majority of the net artworks are not seen as interesting and spectators do not see their aesthetic appeals,
              reason being that these artworks are now considered unpleasing due to the post-internet art. This is because there are innovations of new internet arts which are produced using new technologies 
              with better user interfaces and experiences. This means that art keeps on being influenced by the internet and the internet keeps on influencing the art, 
              what I mean by this is that art uses the algorithms of the internet to show the audience what it is all about and how it can be used for new experiments, on the other hand, 
              the internet displays art to share new information and make copies of original artworks by digitizing them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A copy of the original artwork will be what is displayed and what the audience will be criticizing, which makes me think of whether the copy of the artwork on the internet carries more value and 
              aesthetic appeal than the physical original artwork. The art moving from traditional art to digital art will have a better detail than it would in person as the algorithms of the internet can make it look better, 
              thereof the spectator will analyze the art on the internet differently than they would in person. We can refer to this transfer of art to the internet as migration, which is a strategy whereby artworks 
              are conveyed from old-fashioned technologies to modernized technologies. It is used to make the existence of artworks durable, to neither be dismantled nor forgotten due to resuming them constantly (Rubio & Wharton, 2020:239). 
              This migration causes continuous changing of the original work to reproduce the new one so that the original can be separated from the copy. It requires more work and experiments for artists to establish that the copy still 
              delivers the same meaning as the original even though the internal and external structures may be distinct. The internet is now a platform that enables artists to do migration of their artworks so that everyone can access them 
              and make them exist for a long time for generations to come until there are new innovations.
            </p>

            <h4 className='sub'>The <em>/death/ null</em> by Ulf Schelth (2010)</h4>
            <p>
              The net art that interested me is /death/ null by Ulf Schleth which has been around for more than ten years, see figure 1 which shows the interface of the net art below. Schleth explains it as “a place to bury hatchet. Immortalise the ephemeral. 
              Make a meme memorial. Mark a mortal thought. An Obytuary.” (2010), to elucidate this in simple words, the net art is about taking other artworks and placing them in a safe digital space where they will not lose their existence 
              anytime soon and other user will be able to interact with them when they navigate to the graveyard page where they can access all files. 
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/death null.thumbnail.png" />
                <figcaption className="caption">Figure 1. Ulf Schleth, /death/ null, 2010. (Net Art UI)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              The art’s interface is simple and easy to navigate through as we can see by the image above which shows the page where all the art is transferred to when the user buries their files (the graveyard page), 
              the developer used a simple and colour-blind-friendly palette for the website, he used black as the dominant colour for the text to give us the content. The background is grey to show the importance of the text in each page, 
              then there are white text boxes to show the user where they have to interact with the website and fill in the necessary information. Black, white, and grey are the colours I like to use in all the websites I create same as this website, 
              they bring out the aesthetic appeal of a simple website, and make the layout of each page easy to interact with, the beauty of the art lies in the way a user can always go back to access all the files they buried for memories whereby some 
              can cause nostalgia. It does not matter what type of file the user wants to bury the graveyard accepts all formats of files, it allows the user to bury everything and anything they want, and they can access them anytime and make other people 
              access them as well since the files are not hidden. The layout of the website is nothing complicated it is legible, readable, as well as spacious, the content is easy to understand as the text is kept written in simple terms so that the user does not get confused (Schelth, 2010). 
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a heading in bold letters to show the user what the interface is about which is /death/ null; under the heading there are three navigation links which navigates the user to other pages on the website these are interface, graveyard, and about. 
              The body of the website in the interface page which plays as the home page in the website shows the subtitle written in bold, there is a form where the user can fill in their details to interact with the website, since the website is about burying or migrating 
              (which I briefly discussed above) files into a safe space there is a selection button where the user can select files from their systems which they wish to bury in the null. Then there is a form that allows the user to type in their email address if 
              they want to receive a link to the website or page that will show them their buried files; and lastly there is a button that enables the user to be able to bury their files once they are done with the selection of the file they want to bury. 
              The graveyard page shows the user all the different files that were buried from old files to recent ones, this includes almost all types of files like .pdfs, .jpgs, .html files, etc. I like how the developer made the files have different colour-palettes 
              with the name of the files and the date to show when it was buried, this also helps the user to be able to classify their files. The about page then explains what the website is all about and how it all started, this helps the user understand the design and ideas behind the net art.
            </p>
            <p>
              The net art made me think about a topic we discussed last year about digital fragility and the migration of digital files to increase their life span. Digital fragility simply explained is data shown through symbols that can be easily destroyed by mechanical innovations. 
              Data that is basically weak and stored in different file formats and is temporary (Rubio & Wharton, 2020: 216). Looking back at the net art we can see that the data is stored in an old-fashioned way which does not require much code, so the information stored can be 
              easily destroyed as it needs to be constantly updated and modernized. The files are transferred from one place to another, and it is this continuous transfer of these files that causes them to be destroyed where the user can get a notification saying “the file does not exist…” 
              when they try to access it after some time, by virtue of it constantly changing from ones and zeros to zeros and ones to suit the kind of software it is moved to (Schwarz et al. in Rubio & Wharton 2020: 218).
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, the net art uses internet as a medium to store information from ages back, this information is stored in different types of file formats for a great user experience, as the user can bury any type of file they want no matter how small or vague the information in the file is. 
              The <em>/death/ null</em> helps artists to be able to access work from other artists, it carries memories of different people from all over the world which brings out its aesthetic appeal. We cannot always depend on the neat art to keep memories though because the files are digital, 
              and they can easily be destroyed by new technological innovations which change the algorithms of the internet. The net art is still useful for enabling users to bury files they do not really want to delete, and still want to access in future, but nobody knows how long the files 
              will be of existence with all the changes and innovations that are happening with post-internet art. I wish to design a website like this, where the user will be able to bury files and interact with other people’s files to see memories they can relate to.

            <h2 className='sub'>Artificial Intelligence and Art</h2>
            <p>
              In the past years the definition of art has been explored and artists as well as researchers have 
              been trying to figure out what can be classified as art and what cannot. As I have mentioned in my 
              other blogs that the definitions of art vary but they can all have a common perspective that almost everyone can agree on, 
              and this is that art is a way of expressing oneself, artists design art to express their desires, experiences, and opinions. 
              The growth and innovations of new technologies have separated art into different categories, for example, 
              algorithmic art which is art created using computer programmes (Mazzone and Elgammal, 2019: 1), 
              and traditional art which is art created using traditional tools like paintings. 
              Computers generate art and they are doing a mind-blowing job, but the question is, can these computers 
              be classified as artists? This is a tricky question, and it can have both yes/no answers, 
              because human beings are the ones who create computers then they use these computers to create art. 
              Technological innovations have made artists use algorithmic tools to create art and with these tools, they also created AI (Artificial Intelligence). 
            </p>
            <p>
              In his essay, Can Computers Create Art? Aaron Hertzmann discusses if AI can produce art, I found this interesting because 
              artificial intelligence is taking over, and it is the future (2018). Before we can conclude that AI can produce art and 
              can be considered as the artist, we should bear in mind that computers were also created by people meaning 
              “… there is always a human behind the artwork.” (Hertzmann, 2019:13). Artists keep on exploring and creating new 
              products using programming which results in the creation of new digital artworks which enlighten people about the algorithms of the internet. 
              Now, we are looking at what artificial intelligence is and how it influences art.  Schroer defines AI as 
              “a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks 
              that typically require human intelligence.” (2023). In simple words, AI is a smart computer system that is created by humans 
              to function with the efficiency of a human intellect. 
            </p>
            <p>
              AI is created to do all the things a human can do, and this can be scary because human beings will end up with nothing to do as the AI is taking over, 
              from playing games to problem-solving (Schroer, 2023). Although these innovations are growing the world and improving creativity, 
              people can end up losing their jobs and lose interest in finding ways to problem-solve since they won’t have to do the reasoning anymore, 
              there will also be fewer social interactions between people as most of them will be interacting a lot with their computers. 
              AI is used to create all the things that can be misbeliefs when it comes to the real world, the art that is created by the 
              computer is not as natural as the art created by the human, this is because the human creates art to show other people how they 
              feel about the  real world and how they see it, while computational art is art that is created using data that can be destroyed at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Mazzone and Elgammal, AI is more than just a tool used by artists to create art, it is like a “medium” (2019:8), 
              which means that it has more than just tools for functioning and creating art, it has all the restrictions and many prospects that it 
              obeys for it to create art. Computers cannot be considered as artists because they create art to complete the task that a human being gave to them, 
              they create what they are instructed to do not what they feel like creating to express themselves. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The technology has innovated art to become more delightful and improve artists’ skills through using new tools to create art, 
              they moved from traditional productions to mechanical productions. People around the world can even access the artworks from all 
              parts of the world through the internet since the artworks are computer-generated. There are AIs which humans create and control them 
              to learn how human thinking functions and know what is good and bad, then there are ones which do not have supervision meaning they are not 
              controlled to see what good and bad is and how a human is supposed to think; these unsupervised AIs could end up being the future, 
              whereby they can control themselves and do whatever they want. This scares me a lot because what if we are literally creating monsters?

          <h4 className='subtitle1'>Preparatory Work</h4>
          <h5 className='sub'>My Internet Art</h5>
          <p>
            My main goal for the design of my internet art is to design a user interface like <em>Documenta Done</em> by Vuk Ćosić (1997). The net art used very bright colours to
            catch the user's attention, it uses white, red, and black which are colours I used in my website as well, they are what brings out the aesthetic 
            appeal of the website. The net art was designed as a copy or renewal of a net art project that was known as <em>Documenta X</em> by Catherine David in 1997, 
            Vuk designed <em>Documenta Done</em> (1997) by copying the code and forms from <em>Documenta X</em> (1997) then creating new advanced net art. 
            I found this interesting because it shows that art can be recreated for it to never lose its existence. What I like most about these 
            net artworks is that they show the algorithms of the internet and how people can use it to connect with each other, which is what I wish my internet art to be, 
            an interface that gives the user an opportunity to feel like they are part of the created world. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The artwork is a place where people are free to share their opinions through critical writing, sharing of information, and the showcasing of what 
            is going on around the world through broadcasts (Jones, 2017). It shows what the internet can do in terms of user participation when they interact 
            with the websites or the art on the internet, they can give feedbacks after engaging with what they see. I am planning to design an internet artwork 
            that will show the beauty of the internet and how art on the internet can be interactive, and to show this I am going to use text and images that will 
            allow the user to click on them and view them however they want, I will include icons as well which will allow the user to click on them and show an image. 
            I want the layout to look the same as <em>Documenta Done</em>, see figure 1 below which shows the interface of the net art.
          </p>
          <figure>
              <img src="images/DocumentaDone.png" className='pic'/>
              <figcaption className="caption">Figure 1. Vuk Ćosić, UI page of <em>Documenta Done</em>, 1997.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The interface of the <em>Documenta Done</em> (1997) as shown in the image above has a bright bold red colour that is used as the background to make it stand out, it has textboxes which tells the user more about the net art. 
            I would like my interface to be like this, but this will only show when the user clicks on the icons that will be on the main interface which will look like the old interface of <em>Documenta X</em> (1997), 
            when an icon is clicked it will display an image or textbox depending on which one the user clicks. Looking at figure 2, it shows how the original <em>Documenta X</em>’s interface looked like and 
            this is how I want the main interface of the internet art to look like before the user can interact with it. 
          </p>
          <figure>
              <img src="images/DocumentaX.jpg" className='pic'/>
              <figcaption className="caption">Figure 2. Catherine David, UI page of <em>Documenta Done</em>, 1997.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The interface of the original net art as shown in figure 2 has links and icons that allow the user to navigate to other pages when they click on them. It is simple and easy to navigate, 
            not using many colours and they put white as the dominating colour. At the moment I am going to design the main interface of my internet art as the one of <em>Documenta X</em> because I feel
            like it is going to be simple and easy for the user to engage with, and they will be able to understand how it works and what message it is trying to give out at first glance. So I want to show the user
            that the internet is a exploartion space were artists can play with their thoughts and still express themselves but this time they use the computer algorithms.

          <h2 className='subtitle1'>Additional Research & Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now part of our daily lives, it is used at work, school, on the roads when people are travelling, and even at homes. I have already defined 
            what AI is according to my perspective in the weekly blog, I defined it as a smart computer system that is created by humans to function with the efficiency of a human intellect.
            The main terms that are more important in this definition are a computer system, created, efficiency, and human intellect; I am saying these are the most important terms to take into consideration
            when defining what AI is because they are building blocks of it. To elucidate further, we can consider AI as an digital artwork that humans create to express themselves in a way, they create a system
            they imagined to have all the capabilities of a human, even ones that they themselves cannot reach or do. For example, ChatGPT which is an AI system that was created by OpenAI as a real language clarifying tool 
            that enables the user to have human-like dialogues using a talkbot (Ortiz, 2023). The artists created this digital artwork to allow people to be able to ask any questions they have in mind and get the answers 
            they want to hear also to help them complete tasks that are hard for them, like completing essays for school work.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to the intellectual sense of the AI, same as human beings having different intellectual abilities, AI is designed the same. The intelligence of the AI is measured by how it was created to functions,
            there are two classifications of AI, these are the weak AI and the strong AI. A weak AI is a type of AI that was designed to do limited actions that a human being can do like giving directions, or driving a car; this
            AI was designed to perform only one task distinctively which shows that it is created to have restrictions and is controlled when it comes to the level of human intelligence it should have. An example of this is one that
            almost all of us know which is a Google Search, we all know that when we want to search for something, we are likely to use Google which gives us all the information we want from differnet sources. The weak AI is the type of AI 
            that not exist yet, a system that can come up with solutions to problems that they have never faced before like when human overcome obstacles they face in life. This is the type of AI that does not need to be controlled and
            constrained when it comes to the things it can do (Schroer, 2023). One of the examples of AI that Hans Pruijt looks at is ELIZA which is an AI that was part of the debate on the social iteraction with computers created by Weizenbaum 
            as a natural language processing system (2006: 516-517), the AI is used to give humans answers to all their questions when they communicate with it, this is to make them hear the answers they want to hear through a computer while they interact with it. 
            I consider ELIZA as a weak AI because it has limitaatios and constraints when it comes to what the response must be to the user, it takes the input from the user and is controlled as to what response it must say back to the user as the output (Pruijt, 2006: 518).
